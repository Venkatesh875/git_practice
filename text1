Chess is called the game of kings. It has
been around for a long time. People have
been playing it for over 500 years. Chess
is based on an even older game from
India. The chess we play today is from
Europe.
Chess is a two-player game. One player
uses the white pieces. The other uses the
White Chess Pieces
black pieces. Each piece moves in a special way. One piece is called the king. Each
player has one. The players take turns moving their pieces. If a player lands on a
piece, he or she takes it. The game ends when a player loses his or her king. There are
a few more rules, but those are the basics.
Some people think that chess is more than a game. They think that it makes the mind
stronger. Good chess players use their brains. They take their time. They think about
what will happen next. These skills are useful in life and in chess. Chess is kind of like
a work out for the mind.

Wilson lived in a small village in Kenya, in the
eastern part of Africa. Even though he was
only a ten year old boy, he was an important
member of his family. His family raised cows
and goats. He was given the job of watching
the goats. Wilsonâ€™s family did not have many
other possessions. They drank the milk from
the goats and cows, and sold them when
they needed money. If the cattle died, they
knew that their family might not survive.
Wilson was proud that his father trusted
him with the goats. It was a dangerous job
because lions roamed around and attacked
the herds. Wilson had to be ready to face a
lion, if necessary. His father taught him to be
brave so that he could protect the goats and
his family. He had a spear that was taller than he was. Wilson was very skilled at throwing
the spear.
