Chess is called the game of kings. It has
been around for a long time. People have
been playing it for over 500 years. Chess
is based on an even older game from
India. The chess we play today is from
Europe.
Chess is a two-player game. One player
uses the white pieces. The other uses the
White Chess Pieces
black pieces. Each piece moves in a special way. One piece is called the king. Each
player has one. The players take turns moving their pieces. If a player lands on a
piece, he or she takes it. The game ends when a player loses his or her king. There are
a few more rules, but those are the basics.
Some people think that chess is more than a game. They think that it makes the mind
stronger. Good chess players use their brains. They take their time. They think about
what will happen next. These skills are useful in life and in chess. Chess is kind of like
a work out for the mind.
